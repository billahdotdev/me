            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p>
              I am passionate about JavaScript and web technologies. Before the pandemic, I was just a struggling entrepreneur in the clothing industry. 'GARMENTIK' is a company where I hustled as a rainmaker. My business had its ups and downs, which were stressful, but I was learning something new every day. During the pandemic, I decided to bring my passion into the business.

            <h3>My Learning Odyssey</h3>
            <p>
              My journey into web development began with a curiosity about how websites work. What started as a hobby quickly evolved into a passion as I discovered the power of creating digital experiences that can impact people's lives. Through years of learning, experimenting, and building, I've developed a deep understanding of the web ecosystem and the skills needed to create exceptional digital products.
